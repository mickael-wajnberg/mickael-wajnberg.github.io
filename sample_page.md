## A Partnership with Softwords Consulting : Peekaboo.ai

**Project description:** This project is a highly efficient association rule miner based on my phD thesis work. After graduation, I optimized the project for a commercial version. It is subject to a NDA so no code can be displayed but you can consult the project on [the peekaboo web page](https://peekaboo.ai/). 


### 1. Advantages of relational association rules

Relational association rules present multiple advantages:
- The method is explainable and results are interpretable
- They offer the directionality usual statistics don't provide
- They are descriptive, so it will provide interesting results even with short dataset
- The relational aspect allows to provides deeper insights than joining table and applying classical data mining techniques

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 2. Work content

On the plateform, I produced algorithms in C++ (with CPU parallelisation) to compute the rules from multiple algorithms that I used or designed during my thesis. It also includes an inference engine to apprehend the relational aspect through the AI concept of propositionalisation that comes from description logics. Results are stored in a SQL database for which I designed multiple queries and refined indexes to interact with a front end in React and a PHP Laravel backend (I did not participate in the front end development) 

```javascript
if (isAwesome){
  return true
}
```

### 3. Results

The algorithms resulted in multiple concrete applications, such as in: 
- metal manufacturing
- neurology
- neurolinguistics
- oncology
